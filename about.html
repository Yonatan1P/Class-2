    <p> 
        My name is Yoni, and I am a recent graduate from the University of Washington. I graduate in the spring of 2020 with a Bachelors of Science in Biophysics. 
        I enjoyed studying Quantum Physics and Electromagnetism. I also enjoy playing chess and wrestling, as well as weight training and endurance running. 
        I was born in Israel, but have spent the majority of my life in the Greater Seattle Area, with brief stops in Toronto, Vancouver, and New York along the way.
        I always forget the names of really important historical and scientific figures, so I made this game to help myself (and others) recognize famous physicists.
        I hope you enjoy!
